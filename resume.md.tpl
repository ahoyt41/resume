## Overview

I am a software engineer with 5 years of professional experience focusing
primarily on backend API development, deployment, and data management using
primarily Python and Go. I am passionate about building scalable, secure systems
that improve the lives of their users.

My experience includes building and deploying backend systems that communicate
over protocols such as HTTP, MQTT, and AMQP over a wide domain as well as internal
tools to process and clean large datasets. Some examples include: 

 - gRPC server applications that wrap automatic speech recognition systems.
 - A go command line tool for processing and cleaning JSON transcription files.
 - HTTP/s server applications for managing open source systems such as Keycloak.
 - MCP server applications in python

In addition, I also have experience deploying and managing containerized applications
within environments likes kubernetes and docker swarm.
